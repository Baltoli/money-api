# Money API

This project implements a minimal API for tracking transactions between a group
of people.

## Usage

Run `rackup` to start the app.

The app requires a file with the name `moneyfile` to exist in the same directory
as `app.rb`. The initial state of this file should be a set of space-separated
names on the first line.
